    What To Donate
    <br>
All unopened, unexpired groceries are accepted. Prepared meals from restaurants are also accepted as long as they are labeled with the ingredients and prepared in a commercial kitchen. Currently, the only non-food items accepted are menstrual products.

While that leaves quite a lot of options open, it can also make it hard to know what to bring, so weâ€™ve compiled some suggestions below.

General Donation Tips
Please divide larger packages into their smaller parts or even consider making smaller more regular donations to help spread the usage over more people. This is especially recommended if each individual item has nutritional information on it.
Any cans that are dented on the seam at the top or bottom or along the side, or punctured in any way, will be thrown away.
Reusable bottles and cups, as well as mugs, are welcome to be left near the hot and cold water tap.
