    <h3 id="howToDonate">Donation Guidelines</h3>
    <br>
        <p>
            Please divide larger packages into their smaller parts, or even consider making smaller more regular donations to help spread the usage over more people. This is especially recommended if each individual item has nutritional information on it.
        </p>  
        <p>
            Be sure to place items in the correct area of the fridge. If you're donating bottled water and it's below freezing outside, please place it inside the fridge to keep bottles from bursting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reusable bottles and cups, as well as mugs, are welcome to be left near the hot and cold water tap.
        </p>

            Just show up! If you're interested in dropping off items for the fridge/pantry, you may access the location at any time. Please feel free to stop by! 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a few minutes, it's a great help if you can check for expired, damaged, or open items and discard anything that doesn't belong at the fridge site. Any cans that are dented on the seam at the top or bottom or along the side, or punctured in any way, will be thrown away.
        </p>

            <h3>If you stop by:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>bring plastic bags to the bag slot so folks have a way to carry donations home</li>
                <li>check on the fridge to make sure it, the microwave, and water dispenser are on </li>
                <li>wipe down the fridge and microwave with antibacterial wipes</li>
                <li>check the fridge and pantry for expired foods and throw them out</li>
