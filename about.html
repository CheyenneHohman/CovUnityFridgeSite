            We are excited to announce the Covington Community Fridge, aka the COVUNITY Fridge, at Redden Gardens! Food Insecurity is a real problem in our community so we are building a free fridge and pantry that our neighbors can access 24/7.

            Shelf stable, store-bought items and fresh produce can be directly shared in the fridge at any time, on the alley north of 909 Scott in Covington, KY.
