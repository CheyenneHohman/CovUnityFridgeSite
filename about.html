            The Covington Community Fridge, aka the COVUNITY Fridge, is open at Redden Gardens! Food Insecurity is a real problem in our community so we are building a free fridge and pantry that our neighbors can access 24/7.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shelf stable, store-bought items and fresh produce can be directly shared in the fridge at any time, on the alley north of 909 Scott in Covington, KY.

            Look for the wooden structure with a fridge and cabinets. The items inside are available for anyone, anytime who may need them! Help yourself!
